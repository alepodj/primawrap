    text: "While running my small business, I have always shopped local for my supplies. This is one of the BEST packaging stores in the area, and even if it was 2-3 hours away...  I WOULD STILL SHOP THERE! I absolutely a 'tactile' shopper, and buying online for customer touch points is HARD. I LOVE that (before pandemic) I could go in and feel all the textures, thickness and quality before making a purchase. They only stock high-quality, so if you are online shopping, rest-assured that you are getting a quality product from them. Bracelet boxes, merch sleeves, all gift bags, cello bags, elastic wraps, larger gift/hat/storage boxes are all top quality. There is a little bit of everything. So thankful for their attentive staff, and always leave there feeling like a valued and supported customer.",
